# Multiple Regression Analysis – Business Insights Through Data

## Objective
This project applies multiple linear regression analysis to a business dataset to uncover relationships between a dependent variable (e.g., revenue or sales) and several independent variables (e.g., advertising spend, product pricing, seasonal effects).

The analysis was completed as part of the *Business Insights through Data (DAT-3533 – FMBA1)* course.

---

## Dataset
The dataset includes variables such as:

- Sales Volume
- Marketing Expenditure (TV, Radio, Social Media)
- Seasonal Dummies (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- Product Category
- Market Region

---

## Methodology
- Multiple Linear Regression in Excel
- Inclusion of dummy variables and interaction terms
- R-squared, adjusted R-squared, p-values, and residual analysis
- Model optimization through backward elimination

---

## Key Insights
- Social media spend had the strongest positive correlation with sales.
- The Q4 season was significantly associated with higher sales, possibly due to holidays.
- Certain product categories performed better in specific regions.

---

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Data Analysis Toolpak)
- Data Cleaning and Transformation (manually and in Excel formulas)

---

## Course Context
This project was developed as part of an MBA STEM course focused on business analytics and decision-making using data.
